CASE STUDY :
    Student Attendance System Using Waterfall Model

Problem Statement :
A school wants to develop a Student Attendance System to automate daily attendance recording, generate monthly attendance reports, and notify parents automatically when a student is absent.
The requirements are well-defined and unlikely to change, the Waterfall Model is chosen for system development.

Requirements of the System
To record daily student attendance accurately.
To generate monthly attendance reports for teachers and administration.
To send automatic notifications to parents in case of absence.

Waterfall Model Phases :

Phase 1 : Requirement Analysis
In this phase, all requirements are gathered from the school, teacher and staff. The requirements are documented.

Key activities :
Understand the process of attendance.
Identified users(Teachers, Admin, Parents).
Documented Requirements.

Outcome : 
The requirements are gathered and documented in a Software Requirement Specification (SRS) document.

Example :
Preparing a list of requirements such as daily attendance entry and parent notification.

Phase 2 : System Design
The system architecture and design are prepared. Data structure and interface are designed based on the requirement document.

Key activities :
UI designed.
Database design.
System architecture planning.

Outcome :
ER diagram, flowcharts, system architecture.

Example :
Database design tables for student attendance.

Phase 3 : Implementation
Actual coding of the system is being processed into modules.

Key Activities :
Developing attendance entry module.
Generate notification for parents.
Creating report generation.

Outcome :
There is a developed modules.

Example :
The coding is done to store the attendance of students and notify parents.

Phase 4 : Testing
When the coding is completed the the modules are the modules are integrated and tested for deployment.

Key Activities :
Unit testing.
Component testing.
System testing.

Outcome :
Error free system and reliable.

Example :
The attendance is enrolled or not and either the parents are getting the notification of the attendance.


Phase 5 : Deployment
In this phase, the software is delivered and installed at the customer site and in school.

Key Activities : 
System installation
User access

Outcome :
The system is handover to the users.

Example :
Installing the system in school environment as well as at parents site.

Phase 6 : Maintainance
In this phase, if the errors are found during use of the software, then it is corrected. Can give new updates.

Key Activities :
Bug fixing.
Adding new features.
Updating student records.

Outcome :
Use able system till its lifetime.


Example :
Updates are given of student attendance on academic year.


Advantages of using waterfall model

The Waterfall Model provided a clear, step-by-step structure, helping the school document requirements for attendance, reports, and notifications properly.
Fixed phases made the Student Attendance System easy to plan and manage.

Disadvantages of using waterfall model

Any new requirement, such as adding biometric attendance, is difficult to include once development starts.
 Testing is done late, so errors in attendance or notifications may be found only after full development.
